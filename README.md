# jpg2pdf-converter-python

Having unzipped the programme and saved it to the place of your choice ( ie the Desktop ) do the following:

Add whatever images you want to be converted to PNG into the "Images" folder inside of the root folder.

Open the command prompt and cd into the directory of the programme - ie cd Desktop/jpg2png-converter-python-master

Please note that when typing the command in the next paragraph, depending on which version of python you have installed, you may need to use the command "python" or "python3" ( without the quotes).

Then run the following command:

# python JPGtoPNGconverter.py Images/ New/

This will create a new folder called the name you specified ( in the line above example, it will be a folder called "New"), and the new png images will be saved inside there.
