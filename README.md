# jpg2pdf-converter-python
# Having unzipped the programme and saved it to the place of your choice ( ie the Desktop ) do the following:

# On Windows:

# Add whatever images you want to be converted to PNG into the "Images" folder inside of the root folder ( jpg2pdf-converter-python-master this will be if downloaded from github and not changed ).

# Open the command prompt and cd into the directory of the programme - ie cd Desktop\jpg2png-converter-python-master

# Please note that when typing the command in the next paragraph, depending on which version of python you have installed, you may need to use the command "python" or "python3" ( without the quotes). You can check which version you have by typing without the quotes, "python --version" You can also check if you have python3 installed by typing again without the quotes "python3 --version"

# Then run the following command:
# python JPGtoPNGconverter.py Images\ New\

# This will create a new folder called the name you specified ( in the line above example, it will be a folder called "New"), and the new png images will be saved inside there.

# Note that on windows, if you want to have spaces in the folder name that you are creating ( ie the folder called "New" above ), then surround the name with double quotes. For example if you wanted to make a folder called New Images, you would write it as "New Images"

# On Mac

# Add whatever images you want to be converted to PNG into the "Images" folder inside of the root folder ( jpg2pdf-converter-python-master this will be if downloaded from github and not changed ).

# Open the command prompt and cd into the directory of the programme - ie cd Desktop/jpg2png-converter-python-master

# Please note that when typing the command in the next paragraph, depending on which version of python you have installed, you may need to use the command "python" or "python3" ( without the quotes). You can check which version you have by typing without the quotes, "python --version" You can also check if you have python3 installed by typing again without the quotes "python3 --version"

# Then run the following command:
# python JPGtoPNGconverter.py Images/ New/

# This will create a new folder called the name you specified ( in the line above example, it will be a folder called "New"), and the new png images will be saved inside there.

# Note that on a Mac, if you want to have spaces in the folder name that you are creating ( ie the folder called "New" above ), then pay attention to the slashes.

# For example, if you wanted to make a folder called New Images, you would write it as New/ Images\ so the full line in the exmple above would be:

# python JPGtoPNGconverter.py Images/ New/ Images\
